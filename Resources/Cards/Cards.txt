# MAJOR WIP

# Idea is to have a compendium of the cards until I get the database up and running
# Another good idea is some documentation on all cards with semi-complex + effects. This
# will allow other people (and myself) to use the cards and maintain them in any way. Then
# again that might not be necessary as the only real reason to modify them after creation
# is to edit them to new standards or systems. Will need more thought on this.
