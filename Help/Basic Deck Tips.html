    least 40 cards. Keep in mind that decks with too many cards means you will have
      a smaller chance of drawing the cards you need, so it's best to limit
    your cards to around 40 - 45<br>
    You can have up to 3 duplicates of the same card in your deck. Cards
    included in your Side Deck count towards this 3 duplicate limit. Also, be
    aware of Restricted and Limited Cards.</font></td> <br><br>

     <br><br><b><i>Keep the Monster Card to Magic/Trap Card ratio at 1 : 1<br>
    </i></b>The building blocks of your deck are the monster cards. No matter
    how many powerful Magic or Trap Cards you have, no monsters on the field
    means you've got nothing to defend your Life Points. A general rule of thumb
    is that roughly half your deck should be made up of monsters. Therefore, if
    you've got a deck of 40 cards, around 20 should be Monster Cards.<br>
     <br><br><i><b>Keep the number of High Level Monsters to a Minimum</b></i><br>
    In order to perform a Tribute Summon (required for a Level 5 or higher
    monster), you will have to offer monsters as a Tribute. If your deck is
    filled with high-level monsters, summoning them to the field will be very
    costly. Instead, include lots of Level 4 or lower monsters in your deck and
    keep the number of high-level monsters to a minimum.<br>
     <br><br><i><b>Make Good Use of your Effect Monsters</b></i><br>
    Effect monsters with Magic or Trap effects play an important strategic role
    in your Duels. You can create a powerful Deck if you take full advantage of
    these effects.<br>
    <br><br> <b><i>Include Cards that Increase Opportunities to Draw</i></b><br>
    In a duel, the basic rule is that you can only draw 1 card during the draw
    phase. Therefore, it is strategically to your advantage to be able to draw
    more cards than your opponent. <br>
    <br><br> <b><i>Creating a Side Deck</i></b><br>
    In between Duels, you are allowed to use a Side Deck of 15 cards to adjust
    the contents of your deck. Prepare your side deck with cards that help
    address the weaknesses in your deck or have the power to neutralize specific
    cards.<br>

    According to the Official Rules, certain cards have specific quantity
    restrictions that limit the number that can be included in a deck. These
    limited cards are announced at Official Tournaments and should be take into
    account when customizing your deck.</font></td>
